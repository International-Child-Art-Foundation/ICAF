Bratati Saha, founder of  the Arpan Dance Academy in Ashburn, Virginia,  teaches Kathak, a classical Indian dance form that  incorporates storytelling and religious themes in  its performances. Prayer in Kathak is a devotional  aspect where dancers express reverence through  intricate movements, portraying narratives inspired by  mythology or spiritual texts. The dance may convey  a connection with divinity and invoke a sense of  devotion much like the Whirling Dervishes.    What all these dancers and artists strive to do is to  make dance more accessible so that people can  understand the power of it. They know and believe  dance gives students self-confidence that positively  affects their lives outside the dance studio, such as  in science and technology courses or other aspects  of their lives, such as sports. It also teaches the  integrities and boundaries of student’s bodies which  helps develop a more positive relationship with it.    Some artists in this magazine believe that man does  not exist without movement. Dance is movement and  communication. The idea of dance is to help humans  communicate, and so communication is at the very  heart of what dance is all about. Dance also plays  a big role in cultures; each has its own language. If  shared and developed, dance can be used to bring  people and cultures together.","ChildArt Dance     Dance As A Birthright        Eboné Harden talks to ChildArt           Eboné Harden is the                          I soon realized that dancing also connected me       Director of Education at                       with myself.

Whether you’re into sports or prefer  science and reading, dance can connect you with  your passions and allow you to better connect with  yourself and others.    Everyone has a birthright to dance. So, much as  you might grab a book to read or decide to play  basketball at the park, try picking up dance. You  can dance alone, or you can do it with friends.

Dance  is resistance and resilience.         “We also use dance as    therapy. We go to a school   where students suffer from     poverty, political unrest,     behavioral issues, family   problems or special needs.     Dance gives them a new    meaning and a safe space     where they respect each   other and their differences  and develop their confidence     in themselves and their                  bodies. ”                                                         9","ChildArt Dance                                George Alawi      We don’t have Israeli students with    Zionist background in our studio, but    we work with any artist who recognizes    Palestine, its history, rights, and the    Palestinian people. Dancers and    choreographers have come from all over    the world to collaborate together. We    believe that our unity is our strength. We    are against discrimination, respect each    other, and believe in the importance of    each as humans. Palestine was always    a land of different communities, such as    the Armenians, the Africans, the gypsies,    the Indians, the Jews, Christians, and    Muslims. Everything changed since the    occupation.      I try to make my dance unique by    combining my Palestinian and Arabic    backgrounds in all styles of dance, ballet    or contemporary, expressing what I    am, or my community is suffering. I use    dance to communicate without words. I    believe in the power of movement more    than words. My dance is a fusion of what    I know, each dance style I learned, each    experience in my life, all mixed together    to form a unique formula.      It wasn’t easy at first. Today, I see    people connecting with what my dance    illuminates. My dance resonates    with them.My parents dropped their    opposition to my adopting dance as    a career.

I would  watch music videos on TV (before the era of TikTok  and YouTube) and make up dance routines with  my sister and friends. Nothing could stop me from  dancing.    I studied aerospace engineering at the Pennsylvania  State University. My first year there I enrolled in a  ballroom dancing class to learn the waltz, foxtrot,  swing and Latin social dances such as salsa, cha  cha, rumba, samba, tango and merengue. It was  then that I first discovered bellydance. Watching  Shakira bellyroll and hip shimmy in her “Whenever,  Whereever” music video inspired me, and I signed  up for a bellydance class to learn how to move like  that.                                                             21","ChildArt Dance    “In dance, you identify the  patterns and rhythms in the  music, which also have cultural  context, and analyze and express  the music through your body to  create dance.”                                                                                    Photo by Kate Kotoski    22 Photo by Kate Kotoski","Even though it seems as if dance and engineering        January - March 2024  each work different parts of the brain, they have                                  23  similarities and are related in that they both possess  patterns, numerical rhythms, flow, and mathematical  aspects. Engineering is science and math applied to  creating things and to solving problems. While dance  is more of an artistic expression, it is mathematical  because you are counting the beat. Science, such  as the body mechanics to make your body turn and  spin, is involved in dance. In dance, you identify  the patterns and rhythms in the music, which also  have cultural context, and analyze and express the  music through your body to create dance. In Space,  there are planets and many satellites and objects  in various orbits. Awareness of a satellite’s location  and positioning is very important to communicate  with the satellite and get important science data to  the ground, and to make sure objects don’t collide.  When dancing alone or with a partner and group,  geometry, making shapes, and spatial awareness are  also applied.    Today, I work at the NASA Goddard Space Flight  Center, with Omitron, Inc, supporting satellite  projects - mainly Earth-observing and weather  satellites that help us discover more about our  planet. I like working on satellites because it keeps  me connected to my astronaut and space dreams  I had as a kid.

I had such an experience at  Dartmouth College. I was studying music and  happened to watch the Dance Theater of Harlem  perform on campus. My friends had to convince me  to go. I’m so lucky I went.    For the first time, I saw dancers of color that I could  relate to. They were strong men and beautiful  women. All the stereotypical notions I had about  ballet got tossed aside. I saw the dancers’ athleticism  and elegance. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing  and what was being aroused in me. It was a whole  other world I never knew existed. I got hooked. That  was it. It was a done deal. After the show ended, I  said to myself, “I have to do this.”                                                                            I finished my degree and moved to Washington,                                                                          D.C., to pursue dance.

That’s kind of a snail’s view of the journey and where  I’m at right now, and I’m still discovering things.  Dance taught me about myself, about creativity, and  connecting with my ideas and emotions. Another  advantage of dance, especially for children, is that it  teaches them about the integrities and boundaries  of their bodies. Knowing your body’s strengths and  weaknesses helps you develop a more positive  relationship with it. You can perform better in sports.    You don’t have to join a professional dance  organization like I did to be a dancer. Getting on  stage is a goal many dancers have, but the natural  beauty of dance is that you can do it anywhere  with anyone.
